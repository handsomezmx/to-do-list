# password_validater

The Password Strength Checker is a simple Rust program that allows users to check the strength of their passwords. Users can enter a password and the program will calculate a score based on its length, use of special characters, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters. The program will then output a strength rating for the password.

# Getting Started
To use the Password Strength Checker, you will need to have Rust installed on your computer. If you haven't installed Rust yet, you can download it from the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Once you have Rust installed, you can download the project source code from this repository. To run the program, navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run the following command: cargo run
